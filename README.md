# Belvo Demo Application

This is a guide explaining how to initialize the Application Demo for the Belvo Technical Challenge.

make run
```
4) You'll need to open the address provided at the end of the code execution in the terminal in any browser that you use

# Feedback

The API is quite easy to use and to understand all the functionalities, but I had some issues with the MFA process. For me, the documentation was not very clear.

Regarding the widget, his design is quite remarkable and efficient (for the proposal), I didn't face any issues with him (beside some CORS errors in my localhost).

For improvements, I would review the guide documentation and add more information about, because I felt that some topics were explained only at the surface level (without examples). I would review the access_mode to introduce an easy way to modify that in the app (as per user choice).

For the API, I don't have any improvements to suggest, facing that the API is already amazing and does a great job.
